Production planner module

Reads orders data from vision

Solves a weekly capacity planning problem using constraint optimization

Key Features

Planning Capabilities

Flask Constraint Modeling: Respects physical tooling limitations using effective capacity calculations
Pouring Capacity: Enforces global melt deck tonnage limits
Pattern Limits: Caps weekly production per part
Delayed Pouring: Models time lag between molding and pouring operations
Lead Time Management: Accounts for post-shakeout operations (finishing, heat treat, etc.)
Optimization Features

Lateness Minimization: Primary objective minimizes weighted lateness across all orders
Priority Weighting: Allows differential treatment of critical vs standard orders
Feasibility Checking: Detects infeasible scenarios (insufficient capacity)
Output Schedules

The engine generates detailed weekly schedules for:

Molding: Primary production schedule
Pouring: Derived from molding plan + pouring delays
Shakeout: Flask release schedule
Completion: Finished goods ready for shipping
